# Create With Code 3
#### Concepts and Skills Learnt across the Lessons
- Use GameObject.Find and GetComponent to manipulate the components of the current or other game objects
- Tweak the gravity of your project with Physics.gravity and use ForceModes to apply forces in different ways
- Utilize new operators like “&&” and bool variables to better control game logic
- Freeze or constrain the RigidBody component to halt movement on certain axes
- Use tags to label game objects and call them in the code
- Use script communication to access the methods and variables of other scripts
- Manage animation states in the Animator Controller, including adjusting the states’ parameters and default state 
- Use SetTrigger, SetBool, and SetInt methods to trigger transitions between animation states
- Stop and play particle effects to correspond with character animation states
- Work with Audio Sources and Listeners to play background music
- Add sound effects to add polish to your project
